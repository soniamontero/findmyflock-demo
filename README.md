## Docker development
If you want to use Docker for development, make sure you have Docker for
Mac / Linux / Windows installed on your machine.

1. [Install Docker for your platform](https://store.docker.com/search?type=edition&offering=community)
1. `docker-compose build`
1. `docker-compose up`
    1. This will take over the terminal window you run it in and show the output
    from the running containers. Leave this running and open up a new terminal
    window or tab to run subsequent commands.
1. If you need to initialize the database, run:
`docker-compose exec www bundle exec rails db:setup`
1. View site at `http://localhost:3000/`
    - Use test accounts: `dev@example.com`, `recruiter@example.com`, and
    `admin@findmyflock.com` with password `password`

### Running tests

1. Start up the Docker dev environment as described above.
1. `docker-compose exec www bundle exec rails spec`

## Non-Docker development

### Setup
1. `bundle install` - Install ruby dependencies
1. `nvm use` - Verify you are using the correct version of Node.
1. `yarn` - Install javscript dependencies
1. Get the `master.key` file from another developer and add it to the config/ folder.
1. `bundle exec rails db:create db:migrate` - Create Postgres database and migrate.
1. `bundle exec rails db:seed` - Seed database.

Run the development server and test suite to verify successful deployment. [See wiki for QA walkthrough](https://github.com/findmyflock/www/wiki/Manual-Testing-QA-Checklist).

### Development server
- `bundle exec rails server`
- View site at `http://localhost:3000/`
- Use test accounts: `dev@example.com`, `recruiter@example.com`, and `admin@findmyflock.com` with password `password` (to update).

### Testing
- Install Chromedriver:
    - macOS: `brew cask install chromedriver`
- `bundle exec rspec spec`
- Or run both the server and the tests with `bundle exec guard`. This will re-run tests after every change.

## Development Process
- See [PROCESS](PROCESS.md)
- Follow this [style guide](https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide)
